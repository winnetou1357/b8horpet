Experimental projects with b8horpet
===================================

This repository contains projects (one in each subdirectory) which b8horpet and I use to learn and experiment some tools and technologies that we are currently not familiar with but are interested in.

We organize our projects into subdirectories of this repository. You can find detailed information on each project in its README.md file.
